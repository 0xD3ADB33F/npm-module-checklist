Everyone is welcome to submit pull requests with new content.
I just ask to check before submitting a new content that:

* it is not covered by an item that already is in the list.
* if there is an [open issue](https://github.com/bahmutov/npm-module-checklist/issues),
  please reference it in your commit message.
  You can even check the list of issues from command line before committing `npm run issues`.
* has links to an explanation *why it is a good idea* and tools that help accomplish it.
